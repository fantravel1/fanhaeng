           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="what-are-fan-cafes">1. What Are Fan Cafes? (And Why They Matter)</h2>

      <p>Imagine walking into a regular Seoul cafe and finding it completely transformed. The walls are covered in photo prints of your favorite idol. Custom-designed cup sleeves sit stacked behind the counter. A photo zone in the corner features flower arrangements, LED signs, and hand-painted banners, all created by fans who spent weeks or months planning every detail. This is a fan cafe, and there is nothing quite like it anywhere else in the world.</p>

      <p>Fan cafes, known in Korean as <strong>생일카페</strong> (saengil kape, meaning "birthday cafe") or <strong>생카</strong> (saengka) for short, are temporary pop-up events organized by fan clubs to celebrate an idol's birthday, debut anniversary, comeback, or other meaningful milestone. They are not permanent establishments. They exist for a handful of days, sometimes just a weekend, and then disappear, leaving behind only the memories of the fans who visited and the cup sleeves they collected.</p>

      <p>What makes fan cafes so remarkable is what they represent. These events are entirely fan-funded and fan-organized. Groups of fans pool their money through donations, design custom merchandise, rent a cafe space, decorate it over the course of a day or two, and then open the doors to anyone who wants to celebrate their shared love for an artist. There is no corporate sponsorship, no ticket price, no official involvement from the idol's agency. It is grassroots devotion made tangible.</p>

        <p class="guide-image__caption">Seoul cafes like this one are regularly transformed into fan-organized birthday event spaces, decorated with custom banners, photo zones, and themed displays.</p>
      </div>

      <p>For Korean fans, this tradition is deeply embedded in fan culture. It is a way to express gratitude, mark time, and build community. For international fans visiting Seoul, stumbling into a fan cafe is often one of the most unexpectedly moving travel experiences they have. It is one thing to attend a concert. It is another to see a room full of strangers who care about the same person you care about, and who built this space just to share that feeling.</p>

      <p>This is Korea's most unique fan culture export, and it is one of the reasons FanHaeng exists. No other country produces anything quite like this. And understanding how fan cafes work, where to find them, and how to visit respectfully can transform a good trip to Seoul into one you never stop talking about.</p>

      <!-- ============================================
           SECTION 2: How Fan Cafes Work
           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="how-fan-cafes-work">2. How Fan Cafes Work</h2>

      <p>The mechanics of a fan cafe are beautifully simple, but the effort behind them is anything but. Here is how the entire process works, from the organizers' perspective down to your experience as a visitor.</p>

      <h3>The Setup</h3>

      <p>Fan clubs, often organized through Twitter/X, coordinate birthday cafe projects months in advance. They open donation periods where fans contribute money toward the event. These funds cover everything: the cafe rental fee, custom merchandise production (cup sleeves, photocards, stickers, postcards, sometimes even custom drinks), decoration supplies, printing costs, and flower arrangements. The organizers then negotiate with a cafe to rent their space for a set period, typically <strong>two to seven days</strong>.</p>

      <p>The day before the event opens, the organizing team arrives at the cafe and transforms it. They hang banners, set up photo zones, arrange flower displays, prepare the freebies for distribution, and test everything. By the time you walk in, what was a regular cafe the day before has become a shrine of thoughtful, creative fan devotion.</p>

      <h3>Your Experience, Step by Step</h3>

      <div class="step-list">
        <div class="step-item">
          <div class="step-item__number">1</div>
          <div class="step-item__content">
            <h3>Find and Arrive</h3>
            <p>You discover the fan cafe through social media (more on that in Section 3). You note the address, dates, and operating hours. You arrive at the cafe during its open hours. Some cafes have a line outside during peak times, especially on the first day or during weekends.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="step-item">
          <div class="step-item__number">2</div>
          <div class="step-item__content">
            <h3>Order a Drink</h3>
            <p>This is the most important step. You order at least one drink from the cafe's regular menu. This is how the cafe makes money and how the fan club maintains a good relationship with the venue. Your drink order is what makes the entire event possible. Think of it as your entry contribution.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step-item">
          <div class="step-item__number">3</div>
          <div class="step-item__content">
            <h3>Receive Your Freebies</h3>
            <p>After ordering, you show your receipt to the fan cafe organizers (they usually have a separate table or station). They give you the event freebies: typically a custom cup sleeve for your drink, a photocard set, stickers, and sometimes additional items like bookmarks, postcards, or small prints. Some cafes offer bonus items for fan club members.</p>

        <div class="step-item">
          <div class="step-item__number">4</div>
          <div class="step-item__content">
            <h3>Enjoy the Photo Zone</h3>
            <p>Most fan cafes feature at least one photo zone, sometimes several. These are carefully designed areas with themed backdrops, props, flower arrangements, and light displays. You are welcome and encouraged to take photos here. Just be mindful of other visitors waiting for their turn.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step-item">
          <div class="step-item__number">5</div>
          <div class="step-item__content">
            <h3>Sit, Enjoy, Leave Graciously</h3>
            <p>Find a seat, enjoy your drink, soak in the atmosphere. Look at the decorations. Appreciate the work that went into this. When you are ready, clean up after yourself and head out. If the cafe is busy, be mindful of your time so other fans can enjoy the space too.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <p class="tip-box__title">FanHaeng Tip</p>
        <p>Most fan cafes do not require any fan club membership to visit. They are open to everyone. The organizers want people to come. That said, a small number of events may offer tiered freebies, where fan club members receive extra items. The base experience, including your drink, main freebies, and access to the photo zone, is almost always available to all visitors.</p>
      </div>

           SECTION 3: How to Find Fan Cafes This Month
           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="how-to-find">3. How to Find Fan Cafes This Month</h2>

      <p>Finding active fan cafes in Seoul requires a bit of social media detective work, but once you learn the method, it becomes second nature. Here are the most reliable ways to track down events.</p>

      <h3>Twitter/X Search</h3>

      <p>Twitter (X) remains the primary platform where fan cafe events are announced. Korean fan clubs post detailed event information including dates, location, hours, available freebies, and any special requirements. To find events, search for your idol's name combined with Korean fan cafe keywords.</p>

      <div class="tip-box tip-box--info">
        <p class="tip-box__title">Korean Search Terms to Use</p>
        <p><strong>[Idol name] + 생일카페</strong> — "birthday cafe" (full term)<br>
        <strong>[Idol name] + 생카</strong> — "birthday cafe" (abbreviation, very commonly used)<br>
        <strong>[Idol name] + 컵홀더</strong> — "cup holder/cup sleeve" (another way to find events)<br>
        <strong>[Idol name] + 카페이벤트</strong> — "cafe event"<br>
        <strong>[Group name] + 생일카페 + 2025</strong> — Add the year to find current events</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Fan Cafe Aggregator Accounts</h3>

      <p>Several Twitter accounts specialize in compiling fan cafe events happening across Seoul each week or month. These aggregator accounts are gold mines. They post organized lists with dates, locations, and links to the organizer's account. Search for terms like "서울 생카 일정" (Seoul birthday cafe schedule) to find these accounts, and follow a few of them before your trip.</p>

      <h3>Instagram Location Tagging</h3>

      <p>When fan cafes are active, visitors post photos and tag the cafe's location on Instagram. Searching for popular fan cafe venue names on Instagram's location search can reveal what events are currently running. This is especially useful for discovering events you might not have found through Twitter.</p>

      <h3>The Neighborhood Walk Method</h3>

      <p>This one is beautifully analog. If you are in Seoul and wandering through Hongdae, Gangnam, Sinchon, or any of the neighborhoods known for fan cafes, simply keep your eyes open. Fan cafes almost always have visible signage outside: banners, standees, or poster boards near the entrance. Walking through Hongdae on a weekend during a popular idol's birthday week, you might pass three or four active fan cafes without even trying. Sometimes the best discoveries are unplanned.</p>

           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="where-to-find">4. Where to Find Them — Seoul Neighborhoods</h2>

      <p>Fan cafes appear across Seoul, but certain neighborhoods have become unofficial hubs for these events due to their cafe density, foot traffic, and accessibility. Here is where to focus your search.</p>

      <div class="info-grid">
        <div class="info-card">
          <div class="info-card__icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127751;</div>
          <h4 class="info-card__title">Hongdae (Mapo-gu)</h4>
          <p class="info-card__text">The undisputed capital of fan cafes in Seoul. Hongdae has the highest density of cafe events on any given week. The area is highly walkable, subway-accessible (Line 2, Hongik University Station), and packed with affordable cafes willing to host events. If you only have time for one neighborhood, start here.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
          <div class="info-card__icon" aria-hidden="true">&#10024;</div>
          <h4 class="info-card__title">Gangnam / Sinsa (Gangnam-gu)</h4>
          <p class="info-card__text">Fan cafes in the Gangnam and Sinsa area tend to have a slightly more premium feel. The cafe spaces are often larger, the decorations more elaborate, and the atmosphere a touch more upscale. Events for bigger fandoms frequently land here. Accessible via Line 2 (Gangnam Station) or the Sinbundang Line (Sinsa Station).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
          <div class="info-card__icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127891;</div>
          <h4 class="info-card__title">Sinchon / Ewha (Seodaemun-gu)</h4>
          <p class="info-card__text">The student district around Yonsei and Ewha universities is a quietly excellent fan cafe zone. Cafes here are affordable, the atmosphere is youthful, and the area is easy to navigate. Sinchon Station (Line 2) puts you right in the middle of it. Fewer tourists, more authentic local fan energy.</p>

        <p>Many fan cafes are located on the second or third floor of buildings, not at street level. If you have an address but cannot find the cafe, look up. Building directories near the entrance or stairwell usually list each floor's tenant. Fan cafe event banners placed at ground level near the stairs are another reliable indicator that you are in the right place.</p>

           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="what-to-bring">5. What to Bring to an Idol Birthday Cafe</h2>

      <p>A fan cafe visit does not require much preparation, but a few small things will make your experience smoother and more enjoyable.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your phone, fully charged.</strong> You will want it for photos in the photo zone, for showing your receipt or fan club proof, and for navigating to the location. Bring a portable charger if you are visiting multiple cafes in a day.</li>
        <li><strong>A bag for freebies.</strong> You will leave with cup sleeves, photocards, stickers, and potentially other items. A small tote bag or crossbody bag makes collecting and carrying these much easier, and protects them from getting bent or damaged.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash in Korean won.</strong> While most cafes in Seoul accept cards, some smaller or independent cafes are cash-only. Having 10,000 to 20,000 won in cash ensures you are covered. A typical cafe drink costs between 4,500 and 7,000 won.</li>
        <li><strong>Fan club membership proof (if applicable).</strong> If the event offers bonus items for verified fan club members, have your membership ready to show on your phone. This is usually a screenshot of your membership page or a digital membership card.</li>
        <li><strong>Respectful energy.</strong> This is not a throwaway line. Fan cafe organizers are volunteers who poured time, money, and love into this space. Arriving with genuine appreciation, a smile, and a willingness to follow the rules is the best thing you can bring.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What NOT to Bring</h3>

      <p>Leave the negativity outside. Fan cafes are a celebration. Do not bring complaints about other groups, do not make comparative comments about fandoms, and do not criticize the event or its organizers. Do not bring oversized bags or luggage that take up seating space. And do not bring the assumption that you deserve special treatment. Everyone in that room is there for the same reason: love for the artist.</p>

      <!-- ============================================
           SECTION 6: Fan Cafe Etiquette
           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="etiquette">6. Fan Cafe Etiquette (The Non-Negotiable Rules)</h2>

      <p>Fan cafe etiquette is not complicated, but it is important. These are community-created spaces, and respecting the unwritten (and sometimes written) rules is what keeps this tradition alive and welcoming for everyone.</p>

      <h3>Always Order Something</h3>

      <p>This is rule number one, and it is non-negotiable. The cafe is providing its space for the fan event, and your drink order is what makes that arrangement financially viable. Do not walk in, grab freebies, and leave without ordering. Even if you are not thirsty, order the least expensive drink on the menu. It is a small price for what you receive in return.</p>

      <h3>Do Not Take More Than Offered</h3>

      <p>Fan cafe organizers will tell you what freebies are available per person, either verbally, through a sign, or on their social media posts. Respect those limits. If the allocation is one cup sleeve and two photocards per order, do not ask for more. Supplies are limited and funded by fan donations. Every extra item you take is one that another visitor will not receive.</p>

      <h3>Ask Before Filming or Photographing Other Fans</h3>

      <p>You are welcome to photograph the decorations, the photo zone, your drinks, and your freebies. However, filming or photographing other fans without their consent is not acceptable. Some visitors may not want to be on camera. If you are recording a video, be conscious of who else is in frame. In Korea, privacy around personal image is taken seriously.</p>

      <h3>Do Not Rearrange Decorations</h3>

      <p>The photo zone props, banners, flowers, and displays are carefully arranged by the organizing team. Do not move them for your photos unless there is a clear invitation to interact with them (some cafes have props specifically designed to be held or worn). If something falls or shifts, alert a volunteer rather than rearranging it yourself.</p>

      <h3>Be Kind to Cafe Staff and Volunteers</h3>

      <p>The people running the fan cafe distribution table are almost certainly unpaid volunteers. They may be managing long lines, restocking supplies, and answering the same questions repeatedly, all while funding this event from their own wallets. A simple "감사합니다" (gamsahamnida, "thank you") goes a long way. Kindness is always the right answer.</p>

      <h3>Keep Your Visit Reasonable During Busy Times</h3>

      <p>If the cafe is crowded and there is a line outside, enjoy your drink and the photo zone, but be mindful that others are waiting. A visit of 30 to 45 minutes is typical. If the cafe is quiet, feel free to linger. Reading the room is part of being a considerate guest.</p>

           SECTION 7: Photo Etiquette
           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="photo-etiquette">7. Photo Etiquette</h2>

      <p>Fan cafe photo zones are often the highlight of the experience. Organizers invest significant time and resources into creating visually stunning setups, and they want you to use them. That said, there is an art to enjoying the photo zone without disrupting the experience for others.</p>

      <h3>Photo Zones Are Made for You — Use Them</h3>

      <p>Do not feel shy about stepping into the photo zone and taking pictures. That is exactly what it is there for. The organizers designed it to be photographed, and seeing visitors enjoy it is part of what makes the effort worthwhile for them. Take your time, but be aware of others waiting behind you.</p>

      <h3>Do Not Block Other Fans</h3>

      <p>If there is a line for the photo zone, take a few photos and then move on. You can always come back for another round if the line clears. Standing in the photo zone for ten minutes while others wait is inconsiderate. Two to three minutes per person or group is a reasonable guideline.</p>

      <h3>Do Not Move Props Without Asking</h3>

      <p>If the photo zone has props on a table or mounted on a backdrop, they are placed intentionally. Do not move them to a different location for your shot. If a prop seems designed to be held (a handheld sign, a fan, a lightstick), it is likely fine to pick up. When in doubt, ask a volunteer: "이거 들어도 돼요?" (igeo deureo-do dwaeyo? / "Can I hold this?").</p>

      <h3>Share the Space Graciously</h3>

      <p>If you are visiting with friends and want group photos, that is wonderful. But coordinate quickly and be efficient. If you notice a solo visitor hovering nearby, waiting for a turn, offer them a smile and step aside. Small acts of consideration define the fan cafe experience.</p>

      <h3>How to Take Great Fan Cafe Photos</h3>

      <p>The best fan cafe photos capture the atmosphere of the space, not just your face in front of it. Photograph the details: the cup sleeve on your drink, the handwritten messages on the decorations, the flower arrangements, the overall room setup. These detail shots become the most treasured travel photos because they capture effort, creativity, and love. A wide shot of the whole photo zone, followed by close-ups of the elements that moved you, will tell a better story than a dozen selfies.</p>

           SECTION 8: Birthday Cafe Calendar
           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="birthday-calendar">8. Birthday Cafe Calendar — How Seasons Work</h2>

      <p>Fan cafe events happen year-round in Seoul, but the rhythm of the calendar follows idol birthdays, group debut anniversaries, and comeback promotions. Understanding the patterns helps you plan a trip that maximizes your chances of catching events for your favorites.</p>

      <h3>Peak vs. Off-Peak</h3>

      <p>There is no single "peak season" for fan cafes because birthdays are spread across the entire year. However, some months are naturally busier than others based on the concentration of popular idol birthdays. The weeks surrounding a major idol's birthday often see multiple fan cafes running simultaneously across different neighborhoods, as several different fan clubs organize their own events for the same artist.</p>

      <h3>How Far in Advance Are Cafes Announced?</h3>

      <p>Most fan cafe events are announced two to four weeks before they open. Large, well-funded fan clubs may announce even earlier, sometimes six to eight weeks in advance. Follow the fan accounts for your favorite groups and turn on notifications so you do not miss announcements. If you are planning a trip specifically around a birthday, search for event information starting about a month beforehand.</p>

      <h3>Multiple Cafes for the Same Idol</h3>

      <p>For popular idols, it is common to have three, five, or even more fan cafes running simultaneously in different parts of Seoul during their birthday week. Each cafe is organized by a different fan club and offers completely different merchandise and decorations. This means you can visit multiple cafes for the same idol in a single day, collecting different cup sleeves and photocards from each one. Many fans plan cafe crawls, mapping a route through several events in one afternoon.</p>

      <h3>Off-Peak Benefits</h3>

      <p>Visiting a fan cafe during a weekday or later in the event period (the last day or two before it closes) often means shorter lines, a more relaxed atmosphere, and sometimes organizers are more generous with remaining freebies that they do not want to take home. Off-peak visits can actually be the most rewarding.</p>

           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="first-fan-cafe">9. Your First Fan Cafe — A Gentle Guide</h2>

      <p>If you have never been to a fan cafe before, the idea of walking into one for the first time might feel intimidating. Let this section put those worries to rest.</p>

      <h3>It Is Okay to Go Alone</h3>

      <p>The majority of fan cafe visitors go alone. This is not a group activity by default. Solo visitors are the norm, not the exception. You will not look out of place. You will not need a companion to enjoy the experience. You walk in, you order, you collect your freebies, you take your photos, and you leave. It is perfectly comfortable to do all of that by yourself.</p>

      <h3>Nobody Will Judge You</h3>

      <p>Fan cafes exist because of shared passion. The organizers want you there. The other visitors are absorbed in their own experience. Nobody is scrutinizing what you order, how you pose for photos, or whether your Korean is perfect. International fans are a welcome and appreciated presence at fan cafes. If anything, organizers are often delighted to see that fans traveled from another country to visit.</p>

      <h3>The Experience Typically Lasts 30 to 60 Minutes</h3>

      <p>A fan cafe visit is not a marathon. You can be in and out in 20 minutes if you like, or spend an hour savoring the atmosphere. There is no pressure to stay for a specific amount of time. Order your drink, get your freebies, take photos, enjoy the space, and leave when you feel ready.</p>

      <h3>You Can Visit Multiple Cafes in One Day</h3>

      <p>Fan cafe crawls are a beloved activity among dedicated fans. If multiple events are running for the same idol or different idols you follow, you can absolutely plan a route that hits three, four, or even five cafes in an afternoon. Just be aware that each one requires a drink order, so pace your caffeine intake accordingly.</p>

      <h3>A Sample First Fan Cafe Day</h3>

           ============================================ -->
      <h2 id="what-youll-remember">10. What You'll Remember</h2>

      <p>Long after you leave Seoul, long after the jet lag fades and the routines of home reassert themselves, the fan cafe memories are the ones that tend to stick.</p>

      <h3>The Personal Touches</h3>

      <p>What stays with most visitors is the level of care behind every detail. The hand-lettered signs. The custom drink menus designed with inside jokes only fans would understand. The photo zone that clearly took someone ten hours to assemble. These are not mass-produced events. Every cup sleeve was designed by a fan who loves the same person you love. That personal touch is what separates a fan cafe from any other tourist activity in Seoul.</p>

      <h3>Cup Sleeves as Travel Souvenirs</h3>

      <p>Cup sleeves from fan cafes have become one of the most collected fan souvenirs in K-pop culture. Each one is a unique piece of fan art: beautifully designed, specific to a moment in time, and impossible to get anywhere else. Many fans frame them, display them in their rooms, or carefully store them in collection binders. They are the travel souvenir you did not know you needed, and they cost you nothing beyond the price of a coffee.</p>

      <h3>The Global Connection</h3>

      <p>There is something profound about sitting in a cafe in Seoul, surrounded by people from Korea, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, the United States, Brazil, and a dozen other countries, all quietly celebrating the same artist. Fan cafes are one of the few spaces where the global nature of K-pop fandom becomes physically visible. You might not share a language with the person sitting at the next table, but you share something deeper. That silent recognition, that mutual understanding, is one of the most powerful things about traveling as a fan.</p>

      <h3>Why These Experiences Matter</h3>

      <p>Travel is at its best when it creates emotional resonance, when a place makes you feel something you could not have felt at home. Fan cafes do that. They are not on any official tourism map. They are not advertised in guidebooks. They exist purely because fans decided they should exist. And walking into one, as a visitor from the other side of the world, and being welcomed into that space of shared devotion, is the kind of travel experience that changes how you think about what fandom means.</p>

      <p>That is what FanHaeng is about. Not just getting you to Seoul, but getting you to the moments that matter.</p>

              <p>The best way to find idol birthday cafes is to search Twitter/X using the idol's name followed by Korean search terms like 생일카페 (birthday cafe) or 생카 (abbreviation). Fan cafe aggregator accounts on Twitter compile monthly event lists that are extremely helpful. Instagram location tagging in popular neighborhoods like Hongdae, Gangnam, and Sinchon is another reliable method. Walking through Hongdae on any given weekend will often lead you to several active fan cafes.</p>
