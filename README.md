# FANHAENG.COM — README (v1)
**FanHaeng — Travel as a fan.**  
**Korea-first fandom travel. Global scale.**

FanHaeng.com is not a ticket site.  
FanHaeng.com is not a K-pop news blog.  
FanHaeng.com is not a “Top 10 things to do in Seoul” tourism site.

FanHaeng.com is:

> **The world’s #1 travel guide for K-pop fans, K-drama fans, and Korean cultural pilgrims.**

This README defines the **non-negotiable philosophy, site architecture, signature IP, page templates, tone rules, and scaling plan** for building FanHaeng into a Korea-first mega-site.

---

## 0) The Core Reframe (Non-Negotiable)

### FanHaeng means: Travel as a fan.

FanHaeng is a brand word — not a keyword.

That means the site must always carry its meaning with it.

**FanHaeng must always be presented as:**
- FanHaeng — Travel as a fan.
- FanHaeng — Korea-first fandom travel.

If the tagline disappears, the brand weakens.

---

## 1) The Thesis (The Whole Site Is Built On This)

Korea has the most travel-intense fandom culture on Earth.

Fans travel for:
- concerts  
- idol birthday cafés  
- music shows  
- filming locations  
- pop-up merch drops  
- festivals  
- fan events  
- themed neighborhoods  
- seasonal Korea “vibes”  

FanHaeng exists to answer one question:

> **“How do I go to Korea (or travel globally) as a fan — and do it right?”**

---

## 2) What FanHaeng Is (and Is Not)

### FanHaeng IS:
- a fandom travel infrastructure site  
- a Korea cultural pilgrimage guide  
- a city-by-city concert travel planner  
- a filming-location route builder  
- a fan café + birthday event directory  
- a neighborhood-by-neighborhood Seoul guide  
- a safety-first travel assistant for young fans  
- a high-trust, high-authority fandom resource  

### FanHaeng is NOT:
- K-pop gossip  
- idol drama content  
- paparazzi / TMZ energy  
- “hot takes”  
- ticket scalping  
- fanwars  
- disrespectful tourism content  

FanHaeng is a **fan respect brand**.
