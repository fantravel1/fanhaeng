Get a T-money card at any convenience store, load it with credit, and you can reach any neighborhood in the city for around 1,250 to 1,650 won per ride. Most rides between key neighborhoods take 20 to 40 minutes. Buses are also excellent and reach areas the subway does not. Taxis are affordable for late-night rides, and apps like KakaoTaxi work like Uber with transparent pricing."

      <!-- ===== SECTION 1: HOW TO READ SEOUL ===== -->
      <section id="reading-seoul">
        <h2>How to Read Seoul as a Fan</h2>

        <p>Seoul is not one city. It is dozens of villages pressed together, each with its own rhythm, its own identity, and its own relationship to K-pop culture. The neon-lit streets of Hongdae feel nothing like the polished towers of Gangnam, which feel nothing like the industrial-chic alleys of Seongsu. Understanding this is the first step to planning a trip that actually works for you.</p>

        <p>Every neighborhood has its own fandom energy. Some neighborhoods are loud about it: fan cafes on every block, merch shops stacked three floors high, buskers covering the latest comeback in the middle of the street. Other neighborhoods are quieter, more subtle — the kind of place where you might walk past an entertainment company building without realizing it, or stumble into a pop-up store that only exists for three days.</p>

        <p>How you choose where to stay should come down to your interests. Are you here for concerts? Stay near the venue. Are you here for agency tours and sightseeing? Gangnam or Yongsan makes more sense. Are you a first-timer who wants to be in the middle of everything? Hongdae is probably your answer. Are you a pop-up hunter who lives for limited drops? Seongsu is calling your name.</p>

        <p>Here is the good news: Seoul's subway system connects everything. You are never more than 40 minutes from anywhere. Your neighborhood is your home base, not your entire trip. Pick the one that matches your primary energy, and then let the subway take you everywhere else.</p>

          <p class="guide-image__caption">Seoul's subway system is one of the most efficient in the world — clean, affordable, and with English signage throughout.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <p class="tip-box__title">FanHaeng Tip</p>
          <p>Get a T-money card at any convenience store the moment you land. Load it with 20,000 won and you are set for days of subway travel. It works on buses and taxis too.</p>

              <p class="neighborhood-item__text">Hongdae is where Seoul's creative heart beats loudest. Named after Hongik University and its arts program, this neighborhood has become the spiritual home of K-pop fan culture in Seoul. On any given evening, you will find K-pop dance cover groups performing in the busking zones, surrounded by crowds three rows deep, phones out, cheering like it is a concert.</p>

        <h3>Why Fans Love Hongdae</h3>
        <p>Hongdae is the neighborhood that never sleeps. Walk down the main street on a Friday night and you will pass busking stages where dance crews perform full K-pop choreographies with the precision of actual idols. Fan cafes are clustered throughout the area — BTS, SEVENTEEN, Stray Kids, NewJeans, you name it. Merch shops sell everything from official albums to fan-made photocards. And photo booths (the four-frame kind that Korean fans are obsessed with) are on practically every corner.</p>

        <p>This is also one of Seoul's best nightlife neighborhoods. Clubs, live music venues, and late-night restaurants keep the energy going until the first subway train at 5:30 AM. The food scene is excellent and budget-friendly, with everything from Korean street food to trendy fusion cafes.</p>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Budget travelers: Hongdae has the widest range of affordable guesthouses and hostels in Seoul</li>
          <li>First-timers: The AREX airport line connects directly to Hongik University station, so you can get here from Incheon without a transfer</li>
          <li>Social fans: This is the place to meet other fans from around the world</li>
          <li>Night owls: Hongdae's energy peaks after 9 PM and doesn't stop</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day vs. Night</h3>
        <p>Daytime Hongdae is relaxed and walkable. Browse the shops, visit cafes, explore the free-market area near the playground. But Hongdae truly transforms after dark. The busking stages come alive, the streets fill with people, and the entire neighborhood hums with a kind of energy that is uniquely Seoul. If you only have one night in Hongdae, make it a Friday or Saturday.</p>

        <h3>Getting Here</h3>
        <p><strong>Subway:</strong> Line 2, Hongik University Station (Exit 9 for the main street). Also accessible via the AREX airport line directly from Incheon Airport.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <p class="tip-box__title">FanHaeng Tip</p>
          <p>Hongdae is walkable to both Sangsu and Hapjeong stations, which means your actual exploration radius is much larger than you think. Do not limit yourself to the immediate station area.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Why Fans Love Gangnam</h3>
        <p>The main draw of Gangnam for fans is proximity to entertainment companies. SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, and several other major and mid-tier agencies have their headquarters in the greater Gangnam area (which includes Apgujeong and Cheongdam). Walking past these buildings — seeing the practice room lights on at 11 PM, spotting the company cafes — creates a connection to the industry that you simply cannot get anywhere else.</p>

        <p>Beyond the agencies, Gangnam is home to COEX Starfield, one of Seoul's most impressive shopping and event complexes. COEX regularly hosts fan events, album showcases, and pop-up experiences. The famous Starfield Library inside COEX is one of Seoul's most photographed spaces. Apgujeong Rodeo Street, the upscale shopping district nearby, is where idols themselves actually shop and dine.</p>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Agency tours: Walk past SM, JYP, and other entertainment company buildings</li>
          <li>Premium experiences: Gangnam's hotels, restaurants, and shops are a tier above</li>
          <li>COEX events: If there is a fan event or showcase at COEX, being in Gangnam saves you travel time</li>
          <li>Idol-spotting: Apgujeong and Cheongdam are where idols live, eat, and work</li>

        </div>

        <p>Myeongdong is Seoul's most tourist-friendly neighborhood, and for good reason. It is centrally located, easy to navigate, packed with shopping, and almost everyone working in the area speaks at least basic English (and often Japanese and Chinese too). For fans, Myeongdong's main appeal is K-beauty. This is the global epicenter of Korean cosmetics and skincare shopping.</p>

        <h3>Vibe</h3>
        <p>Shopping paradise, beauty fandom, neon and energy, central and accessible. Myeongdong is loud, crowded, and unapologetically commercial — but it is also incredibly convenient and fun for a day or two. The main shopping street is pedestrian-only in the evenings, and the density of stores, restaurants, and street food stalls creates a market-like atmosphere that is genuinely exciting.</p>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>K-beauty shopping: Flagship stores from Innisfree, Olive Young, Laneige, Sulwhasoo, and dozens more line the main streets</li>
          <li>First-time Korea visitors: Myeongdong is designed for tourists and everything is easy here</li>
          <li>Central location: You are walking distance from Namsan Tower, Namdaemun Market, and Namsangol Hanok Village</li>
          <li>Street food: Myeongdong's food stalls are legendary — egg bread, tornado potato, cheese corn dogs, and more</li>

              <p class="neighborhood-item__text">Seongsu is where old factories become art galleries, warehouses become cafes, and every other storefront seems to be a pop-up store that was not there last week. This former industrial district has been transformed into Seoul's trendiest neighborhood — and K-pop companies have taken notice. If you see a limited-edition album pop-up or photo exhibition announced on social media, there is a very good chance it is happening in Seongsu.</p>

        <h3>Why Fans Love Seongsu</h3>
        <p>Pop-up stores are Seongsu's main draw for fans. Major entertainment companies — HYBE, SM, JYP, YG — regularly launch album-themed pop-up experiences here. These are not simple merch tables. They are fully designed immersive spaces with exclusive products, photo zones, interactive installations, and limited items you literally cannot buy anywhere else. Some run for only a few days. Others last a few weeks. Checking pop-up calendars before your trip is essential.</p>

        <p>Beyond pop-ups, Seongsu is a cafe lover's paradise. The neighborhood is packed with aesthetically stunning coffee shops housed in converted factories and warehouses. Every corner is Instagram-worthy, and the design-forward culture means even the smallest shop feels curated and intentional.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pop-up hunters: If limited drops are your priority, Seongsu is non-negotiable</li>
          <li>Instagram and photo culture: Every block has something worth photographing</li>
          <li>Trendy fans: Seongsu is where Seoul's creative class goes, and the vibe reflects that</li>
          <li>Cafe hopping: Some of the best and most unique cafes in all of Seoul are here</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Here</h3>
        <p><strong>Subway:</strong> Line 2, Seongsu Station or Ttukseom Station. The neighborhood is walkable once you arrive, with most pop-ups and cafes concentrated between these two stations.</p>

          FanHaengScore&#8482; <span class="score-badge__value">86</span>
        </div>

        <p>If you are coming to Seoul for a concert, Jamsil is the neighborhood you need to know. This is where KSPO Dome (Olympic Gymnastics Arena), Olympic Stadium, and the broader Olympic Park complex are located. Some of the biggest K-pop concerts in the world happen here — BTS, BLACKPINK, Stray Kids, SEVENTEEN, aespa — and staying nearby can make the difference between a perfect concert night and a stressful one.</p>

        <h3>Vibe</h3>
        <p>Stadium energy, family-friendly, Lotte World, lakeside walks. Jamsil is more residential and less "trendy" than Hongdae or Seongsu, but on concert days it transforms completely. The area around the venues fills with fan zones, merch booths, food trucks, and thousands of fans in matching fandom colors. The energy is electric.</p>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Concert-goers: Walking distance to KSPO Dome and Olympic Stadium means you skip the post-concert subway crush</li>
          <li>Lotte World fans: Korea's largest indoor theme park is in Jamsil, along with Lotte World Tower and its observation deck</li>
          <li>Relaxed mornings: Seokchon Lake near Lotte World is beautiful for morning walks, especially during cherry blossom season</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stay Here If</h3>
        <p>You have a concert at KSPO Dome or Olympic Stadium and want to be walking distance from the venue. Post-concert subway lines can be extremely crowded — wait times of 30 minutes or more are common after major shows. Staying in Jamsil means you walk back to your hotel instead of battling the crowd. You can also leave your extra bags at the hotel, change after the concert, and be in bed within 15 minutes of the show ending.</p>

        <h3>Transport Reality</h3>
        <p>Jamsil is on Line 2, which is Seoul's most important circular line. Getting to Hongdae takes about 40 minutes, Gangnam about 15 minutes. On non-concert days, the area is quiet and suburban. On concert days, everything changes — subway stations get crowded hours before the show, and rideshares surge. Plan accordingly.</p>

        <div class="tip-box tip-box--info">
          <p class="tip-box__title">Concert Day Strategy</p>
          <p>Book your Jamsil hotel months in advance for major concerts — demand spikes when concert dates are announced. If the area is sold out, Samseong (COEX area) or Gangnam are nearby alternatives still on Line 2.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Itaewon and the broader Yongsan area sit at a fascinating crossroads. This is Seoul's most international neighborhood — a place where Korean culture mixes with global influences, where the restaurants serve everything from Mexican to Ethiopian to Indian food, and where you are just as likely to hear English or Japanese on the street as Korean. For international fans, this can feel like a comfortable home base with a distinctly global energy.</p>

        <h3>Why Fans Love It</h3>
        <p>The biggest fan draw in this area is HYBE. The HYBE building (home of BTS, SEVENTEEN, TXT, LE SSERAFIM, and NewJeans) is located in the Yongsan area. HYBE Insight, the company's immersive museum and fan experience, was a major destination when it operated, and the area around the building continues to draw fans who want to see where their favorite artists work. Even standing outside the building and looking up at the practice room floors creates a moment of connection.</p>

        <p>Beyond HYBE, Itaewon offers something that other neighborhoods do not: comfort food from home. If you have been eating Korean food for five straight days and desperately need a burger, a taco, or a plate of pasta that tastes like it actually came from Italy, Itaewon is your answer. The dining scene is the most diverse in Seoul.</p>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>International fans wanting comfort: English is widely spoken, international food is everywhere</li>
          <li>HYBE fans: The HYBE building and surrounding area are a pilgrimage destination</li>
          <li>Global fan meetups: Itaewon's international crowd makes it natural territory for multi-fandom meetups</li>
          <li>Foodies: Seoul's most diverse restaurant scene, bar none</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Here</h3>
        <p><strong>Subway:</strong> Line 6, Itaewon Station. For the HYBE building area, Yongsan Station (Line 1 / KTX) or Sinyongsan Station (Line 4) are closest.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <p class="tip-box__title">FanHaeng Tip</p>
          <p>Itaewon has undergone significant changes in recent years. Some parts of the neighborhood are quieter than they used to be, while others are thriving. Check current reviews and recommendations before booking accommodation here.</p>

        <p>Sinchon and the adjacent Ewha Women's University area make up one of Seoul's most vibrant university districts. The energy here is young, affordable, and unpretentious. Unlike Hongdae, which has become increasingly commercial, Sinchon retains more of its student-area authenticity. It is the kind of neighborhood where a full meal costs 7,000 won, where cafes are designed for studying rather than Instagram, and where the pace is just a little more relaxed.</p>

        <h3>Vibe</h3>
        <p>University energy, budget-friendly, young and lively, slightly less touristy than Hongdae. The main street between Sinchon Station and Ewha Womans University is lined with affordable restaurants, clothing shops, beauty stores, and the kind of small independent cafes that feel like discoveries.</p>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Budget fans: Accommodation and food are significantly cheaper than Hongdae or Gangnam</li>
          <li>Fan caf&eacute; hopping: Several fan cafes operate in the Sinchon area, often with lower crowds than Hongdae equivalents</li>
          <li>Student-area energy: If you are in your teens or twenties and want to feel like a local university student for a few days, this is the place</li>
          <li>Walking to Hongdae: Sinchon is literally one subway stop from Hongdae, and walkable in about 15 minutes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Here</h3>
        <p><strong>Subway:</strong> Line 2, Sinchon Station. For the Ewha area, Ewha Womans University Station (Line 2) is one stop further.</p>

        <p>Hapjeong and the broader Mapo area are where fans who have done Seoul before end up staying. This is the hidden gem of the city — a neighborhood with incredible cafe culture, excellent restaurants, a creative local scene, and none of the tourist-area markup. Hapjeong sits right between Hongdae and Mangwon, giving you walking access to multiple neighborhoods while staying in a quieter, more residential area.</p>

        <h3>Vibe</h3>
        <p>Local, creative, cafe culture, authentic. Hapjeong feels like a neighborhood where actual Seoulites live and work, because it is. The streets are lined with independent coffee roasters, small galleries, bookshops, and restaurants that locals have been going to for years. There is a sophistication here that is quieter than Gangnam and more genuine than the tourist-facing parts of Hongdae.</p>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fans who want authentic Seoul without tourist crowds</li>
          <li>Repeat visitors who have already done the main fan neighborhoods</li>

          <li>Central base: Walking distance to Hongdae, one stop from Sinchon, easy subway access everywhere</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Here</h3>
        <p><strong>Subway:</strong> Line 2 or Line 6, Hapjeong Station. One stop from Hongik University Station on Line 2. The neighborhood extends toward Mangwon Station (Line 6) for even more cafe and restaurant options.</p>

          <p class="tip-box__title">FanHaeng Tip</p>

          <p class="tip-box__title">Remember</p>
          <p>Your neighborhood is your home base, not your prison. Seoul's subway makes everything accessible. A trip from Hongdae to Gangnam takes 35 minutes. Jamsil to Seongsu takes 15. You are never far from anything. Choose the neighborhood that matches your primary energy, and let the subway take care of the rest.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">The best Seoul neighborhoods for K-pop fans are Hongdae for dance culture and fan cafes, Gangnam for entertainment company headquarters and premium shopping, Seongsu for pop-up stores and limited merch drops, and Jamsil for concerts at KSPO Dome and Olympic Stadium. Each neighborhood offers a different fandom experience, so the best choice depends on your specific interests and trip priorities.</p>

              What is the best Seoul neighborhood for concerts at Jamsil?

            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Jamsil and the surrounding Songpa district are the best neighborhoods to stay in if you have concerts at KSPO Dome or Olympic Stadium. Staying in Jamsil puts you within walking distance of both venues, which means you can avoid the post-concert subway rush and take your time leaving the venue. Hotels near Jamsil Station on Line 2 offer the most convenient access, and the neighborhood also has Lotte World and Seokchon Lake for daytime activities.</p>

              Is Hongdae or Seongsu better for pop-up merch drops?
              <span class="faq-item__icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-item__answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Seongsu has overtaken Hongdae as the primary pop-up destination in Seoul. Major entertainment companies now regularly choose Seongsu for album pop-ups, photo exhibitions, and limited merch drops due to the neighborhood's industrial-chic aesthetic and walkable layout. However, Hongdae still hosts some pop-ups and has a denser concentration of permanent merch shops and fan cafes. If pop-ups are your primary goal, prioritize Seongsu. If you want a broader mix of fan activities, Hongdae offers more variety.</p>

            <div class="faq-item__answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">First-time K-pop fans should strongly consider staying in Hongdae. The neighborhood has the highest concentration of budget-friendly accommodations, fan cafes, merch shops, and street culture in Seoul. It is directly connected to Incheon Airport via the AREX line, is on subway Line 2 which circles the city, and has a vibrant nightlife scene that keeps the energy going well past midnight. Myeongdong is another solid option for first-timers who prefer a more tourist-friendly environment with easy access to K-beauty shopping.</p>

              <p itemprop="text">Seoul's subway system is one of the best in the world and connects all major fan neighborhoods easily. Get a T-money card at any convenience store, load it with credit, and you can reach any neighborhood in the city for around 1,250 to 1,650 won per ride. Most rides between key neighborhoods take 20 to 40 minutes. Buses are also excellent and reach areas the subway does not. Taxis are affordable for late-night rides, and apps like KakaoTaxi work like Uber with transparent pricing.</p>
